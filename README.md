# diabetes_forecasting repository

This repository contains the code required to run a series of experiments on personalized forecasting of the glycemic curve or a sample patient. 

Due to the confidentiality of source data, only code is and will be available, and as we know, it's very nice to have machine learning algorithms available, but they all amount to nothing if we have no idea about the problem it's designed for.

Anyway, this is just some playground on this sort of data for now. And if it helps you in any imaginable way, welcome it be!

## Requirements
- python >= 2.7
- numpy >= 1.14
- matplotlib >= 1.5.0
- docopt >= 0.6.0
- tqdm >= 4.19.0
- pytorch >= 0.3.1
